## How to install

You'll need NPM for grunt so you can build everything out to run locally. I used [Anvil](http://anvilformac.com) to run this locally, but it's not entirely necessary. Just opening the index.html file should be sufficient. 

	npm install -g grunt

Then all you have to do is build for production:

	grunt prod

Everything will be nice and minified and built (and tossed in the lib folder).
